# MyMusicPlayer

A simple music player application in Android. It displays a list of songs on the device's SD Card and allows the user to make selections in the list. The user has various controls on the media player like skipping tracks to the previous/next ones or playing, pausing, rewinding and seeking a particular point in the track.

The app also displays a notification when the track plays so that the user can jump back to the music player after switching between apps.
